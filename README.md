# CodeClauseInternship_Calculator

The "Simple Calculator" project in Python endeavors to provide a straightforward and efficient tool for basic arithmetic operations. 
This console-based calculator interacts with users through a menu, offering options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Users input two numbers for the desired operation, while the program utilizes functions like `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` to perform the calculations. 
To enhance the user experience, the calculator incorporates error handling, preventing division by zero and providing clear messages for invalid input. 
Operating within a loop, users can perform multiple calculations without restarting the script, and an option to exit gracefully is available. 
The code maintains modularity by organizing functions, ensuring readability, and facilitating future enhancements. 
Overall, the project combines simplicity with functionality, creating an accessible calculator for basic mathematical computations in a Python environment.
